<h2>Hyperparameter tuning using Gradient decent</h2>

This is proposed idea by me about hyper parameter tuning. After the obtained output from the Grid search and applying gradient decent with a loss function associated with it might give us the optimal parameter inside and outside the scope of the data.

I am open to any changes provided by anyone. I couldnt find any related research associated with finding the exact polynomial functions that would be related to the cost function.
