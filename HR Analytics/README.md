HR Analytics

This is an IBM attrition rate analysis project. The link to the data is https://www.kaggle.com/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset . I have tried different techniques like PCA and Box-cox transformation for the analysis. In this short project i have used Random forest and linear regression with hard coded Cross fold to measure presicion, accuracy, Recall, and F1score.
